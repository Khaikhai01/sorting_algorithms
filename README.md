Sorting algorithms & Big O
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

Tasks
0. Bubble sort - function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
1. Insertion sort - function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
2. Selection sort - function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
3. Quick sort - function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
